# Remember to Blink

An overengineered solution for a simple problem: I don't blink enough while using a computer.

An iOS app that uses the [Muse headband](http://www.choosemuse.com) to detect blinks and then annoys the user if they haven't blinked for 10 seconds.

## Annoying things

Fun things the phone does until you blink

- Flashing the screen
- Vibrating the phone
- Playing alert sounds

The screen also gradually turns red from black until you blink
